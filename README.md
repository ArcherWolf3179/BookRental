The current project was to explore basic CRUD functions then expanded on connecting the backend and the frontend although all ui features aren't fully developed.

Anyone who cares about the code in this project continue

So there's two files so far at the time of writing this

mongo.py

This controls everything to do with mongo db. This has all the CRUD functions used to make this entire thing work.
This is also the first file created so it doesn't have the cleanest code well neither does this entire project.
